  //canvas is basically a block of pixels. However you cannot draw on canvas element in HTML.
  //We draw on something called as context. The context can be 2D or 3D. We are using 2D here 
  //3D is basically for gaming 

  //The Canvas API provides a means for drawing graphics via JavaScript and the HTML <canvas> element.
  //The Document.getElementById() method gets a reference to the HTML <canvas> element. Next, the HTMLCanvasElement.getContext() method gets that element's contextâ€”the thing onto which the drawing will be rendered.

//we will use the new API called fetch

//fetch will return a promise, not the data. Promise is like something will eventually come back from fetch. How we can work with the promise is we can put .then() against it. It will return a blob of data. 
//but the data that comes back from our fetch it doesnt know what format the data is. We explicitly know that its JSON. even if we do JSON.parse(blob) but this will not work bcoz blob should be converted from raw data to JSON.
//blob has a method json blob.json() now even this will return another promise .then() against it. Now this will give you a raw data i.e, an array.
//Now to push these items into cities array. cities.push(data) this will give array of array i.e, nested array.  cities.push(...data) will work
